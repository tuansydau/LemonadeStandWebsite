# Code Review

Dear candidate, thank you very much for you submission to the 
Backend Developer Co-op Position.

As a sign of respect and appreciation for the time you spent on this task,
I decided to give you a feedback about your code and I hope that this 
experience will be educational for you.

My feedback does should not imply your acceptance or rejection to the internship 
program. All candidates got a feedback like this.


## My comments

### Best practices:

- Use [requirements.txt] for installing Python packages (e.g. Django)

- Use [.gitignore] to exclude files from the source code you commit into git

- Never commit your DB to git. If you need to create initial data for the project,
  like in this project, use Django's [data migration] scripts or [fixtures]. 

- Extend your templates using [base.html]. 
  You used base.html in sales but it is better to have one for the whole project...
