# MEGAComfort-Backend

This is a website created using HTML, CSS, Django for the MEGAComfort Backend Development Challenge. Unfortunately I was unable to complete the challenge, but have made enough progress to warrant a submission. I'm grateful to have taken this challenge; the challenge was quite fun and I've learned a lot during the process of making this website. 

<h3>How to run</h3>

1. Clone the directory to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/tuansydau/MEGAComfort-Backend.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned folder.

```
cd MEGAComfort-Backend
```

3. Migrate the database.

```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

```
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Run server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Access the server in your browser with either 127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000 in the address bar.


Thank you for the coding challenge!
