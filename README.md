# MEGAComfort-Backend

This is a basic website created using Django for the MEGAComfort Backend Development Challenge. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the challenge, but am still submitting the results. I'm humbled to have taken this challenge, it was quite fun and I've learned a lot during the process of making this app. 

<h1>How to run</h1>

1. Clone the directory to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/tuansydau/MEGAComfort-Backend.git
```

2. Navigate into the cloned folder.
